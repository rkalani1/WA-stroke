## 🚀 Next Steps & Improvements

### Immediate (Optional)
- [ ] Add the workflow file (browser is open, paste and commit)
- [ ] Manually trigger first workflow run to test automation

### Future Enhancements
1. **Improve Geocoding**
   - Add Google Maps Geocoding API for better accuracy
   - Implement caching to avoid re-geocoding
   - Add fallback geocoding services

2. **Add More Data Sources**
   - Implement WA DOH scraping (placeholder exists in code)
   - Add hospital affiliations
   - Include board certifications

3. **Enhanced Features**
   - Clustering for overlapping markers
   - Filter by specialty (vascular vs general)
   - Export provider list to CSV/PDF
   - Contact information verification

4. **Performance**
   - Add marker clustering for dense areas
   - Implement lazy loading for large datasets
   - Optimize API rate limiting

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Map Not Loading
- Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub Pages deployment
- Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
- Check: https://github.com/rkalani1/WA-stroke/deployments

### No Markers Visible
- Zoom out on the map
- Only 19 providers currently have coordinates
- More will appear as geocoding improves

### Workflow Not Running
- Make sure you committed the workflow file
- Check Actions are enabled: Settings → Actions
- View logs: https://github.com/rkalani1/WA-stroke/actions
